# SpotifyDataViz
As part of our lectures we were supposed to scrape our own data and visualize the data in a appealing way. 

In this directory I scraped song data with the spotify api and compared 2 playlists of two of my friends with each other. This directory contains 2 scripts called data_retrieval.ipynb and story.ipynb. The first one mentioned contains the code how I scraped the 2 playlists using multiple endpoints of the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api). The second one contains multiple plots comparing the playlists with other. 

More information can be found in the individual scripts.
